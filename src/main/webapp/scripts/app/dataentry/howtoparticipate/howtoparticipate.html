                    in an Excel preformatted document. This document synthetizes published information on antimalarial
                    medicinal plant uses, pharmacological tests, in different countries, regions and communities where
                    malaria is endemic.

                <p class="text-justify">Data are obtained from journals, reviews, reports, books and proceedings from
                    conferences, reporting the use of plants against malaria together with their antimalarial
                    evaluation, through in vivo and/or in vitro tests/clinical tests, published all over the world.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Thus, ethnobotanical publications reporting antimalarial medicinal plant uses
                    are welcomed for inclusion, as well as pharmacological ones dealing with antimalarial activity of
                    plant extracts and of pure compounds isolated from medicinal plants.

                <p class="text-justify">Only publications reporting plant species with Latin binomials are included.
                    Publications containing solely vernacular name of plant species are discarded.
