                        <em>Erythrocyts</em>: Classically drugs are added to <em>P. falciparum</em> cultured in red
                        blood cells and the activity of the drugs is determined by isotopic ([3H]-hypoxanthine),
                        enzymatic (LDH), fluorometric (syber green) or visual (microscope) methods.

                        <em>Liver stage</em>: Drugs are tested on human or rodent species of Plasmodium. Primary human
                        (HH) or murine hepatocytes (MH), are infected with murine malaria or P. falciparum sporozoites.
                        Compounds are added simultaneously with sporozoites at different concentrations. The culture
                        medium is then replaced 3h after sporozoites inoculation and then on a daily basis. The
                        inhibitory effect of the compound is quantified, after fluorescent immunostaining of the
                        liver-schizonts with a mouse serum raised against PfHSP70 through fluorescence microscopic
                        analysis (some variations are also described in the literature).

                        <em>Gametocyte</em>: <em>P. falciparum</em> cultures are submitted to different types of
                        stimulation to generate gametocytes and gametocytes are counted with an optical microscope (some
                        variations are also described in the literature) after the drug challenge.
                        <em>Sporozoites</em>: They are collected from salivary glands and challenged with the drugs
                        prior infecting hepatocytes (see liver stage).

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Many Cell types can be used to screen for toxicity both by estimation of the basal functions of
                        the cell or testing specialized cell functions. SI refers to the ratio of the toxic dose of the
                        drug (or TC50) divided by the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect (IC50 in
                        Plasmodium). The higher the SI, the higher is the selective antiplasmodial activity of a given
                        extract or compound.
