            <h3>Objectives</h3>

            <p>The Malaria Plant Community Database has been designed to <strong>register and synthesize</strong>
                published (or to be published) information and grey literature (literature outside of commercial or
                academic publishing) on antimalarial medicinal plants: Their traditional use and/or their in vitro/in
                vivo biological activity, and/or toxicity.</p>

            <p>The database is not a substitute for published material, as only relevant data from the publication
                (considered to be fundamental for result interpretation) has been retained.</p>
