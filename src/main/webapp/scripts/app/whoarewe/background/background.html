                <p class="text-justify">According to the W.H.O., traditional medicine and medicinal plants are the
                    primary health resource for more than 80% of the world population.  Medicinal plants have given
                    and still provide a huge amount of natural substances used to create commercialized drugs, but
                    are also widely used in the form of traditional remedies and/or phytotherapeutic
                    preparations.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">In the field of malaria, medicinal plants have been used for centuries, as
                    indicated by written pharmacopoeias. As an example, <i>Artemisia annua</i> L., a Chinese
                    medicinal herb, is currently the source of a first line antimalarial compound, Artemisinin (its
                    discovery led to the attribution of the 2015 Nobel Prize). This plant has been reported for its
                    use against fever in ancient Chinese pharmacopoeias dating from the IV<sup>th</sup> century.
                    This is also the case for the <i>Cinchona tree</i>, discovered in South America centuries
                    ago, which comes from. In the fight against malaria, medicinal plants still play a highly
                    important role, as source of commercialized drugs; but also in the form of numerous homemade
                    remedies and/or phytoproducts prepared and sold locally in endemic countries.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Indeed, many scientific studies confirm the fact that in areas where
                    manufactured drugs are not available, or too expensive, the first treatment in cases of febrile
                    episodes is medicinal plants. Over 1200 plant species have been described in scientific
                    literature for use in malaria treatment.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Recently, strong financial efforts have been invested in the fight against
                    malaria through the implementation of integrated programs, resulting in a dramatic decrease in
                    malaria cases and mortality. Unfortunately, this situation is fragile, strongly dependent upon
                    international support. Also, due to the permanent evolution of parasites and vectors there is a
                    constant need for new drugs. Thus, medicinal plants and traditional antimalarial treatments
                    still continue to be invaluable in the fight against disease.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Publications on antimalarial screening of selected species began in 1947,
                    with the research of Spencer et al. working on a <i>Plasmodium</i> bird model <i>in vivo</i>,
                    in South America. Then, almost 30 years later, the <i>in vitro</i> culture of <i>P.
                    falciparum</i> amplified the screening process leading to bioassay-guided fractionation of
                    plant extracts in the search for new antimalarial drugs from natural resources. Many articles
                    now aim to explore the pharmacological relevance of plants and remedies used against
                    malaria.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">However, when researching the use and effectiveness evaluation of
                    antimalarial medicinal plants, it is difficult to retrieve complete information in a
                    synthetic form. The literature is found partly referenced in international databases (such as
                    Pubmed, Science Direct) partially accessible online, but also in books, grey literature and
                    other hard copy formats. This dispersal of information is a hindrance when attempting to draw
                    definitive conclusions and make decisions. Therefore, a primary of aim of Malaria plant DB
                    community is to fill this gap, by compiling comprehensive data about antimalarial plants,
                    their uses and evaluation.</p>

                    is of great importance to build and share a repository of information on antimalarial medicinal
                    plants, with the aim of facilitating the transmission and preservation of this threatened wisdom
                    for the future.</p>
